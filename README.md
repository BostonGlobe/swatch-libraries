# Swatch Libraries
A collection of official color swatches for the Boston Globe, Boston.com, and other relevant projects.


## Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase)
Use the `.ase` files in this repo to ensure consistent color use in working with the Adobe Creative Suite. 


## Markdown (.md)
Markdown breakdowns of the colors have also been provided, for easy reference and copy/paste efforts for design and development. HEX, RGBa, and HSLa values are included.


## Installation
Place the desired `.ase` files in following locations to have them appear natively in the swatch loading menu:


### Photoshop
`~/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Color Swatches/`


### Illustrator
`~/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CS6/Presets/Swatches/`


### Indesign
`~/Applications/Applications/Adobe InDesign CS6/Presets/Swatch Libraries/`


### Note
It may be a lot easier/more efficient maintenance-wise to clone the swatch files to a single location (say `~/Dropbox/Swatches/`), then load them in-app as needed.
