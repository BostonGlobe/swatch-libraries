# Swatch Libraries
A collection of official color swatches for the Boston Globe, Boston.com, and other relevant projects.

## Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase)
Use the .ase files in this repo to ensure consistent color use in working with the Adobe Creative Suite.

## Installation
Place the desired .ase files in following locations to have them appear natively in the swatch loading menu:

### Photoshop
`~/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS3/Presets/Color Swatches/`

### Illustrator
`~/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CS3/Presets/Swatches/`

### Indesign
`~/Applications/Applications/Adobe InDesign CS3/Presets/Swatch Libraries/`

### Note
It may be a lot easier/more efficient maintenance-wise to clone the swatch files to a single location (say `~/Dropbox/Swatches/`), then load as needed.
