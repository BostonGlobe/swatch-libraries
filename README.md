## Resources

### Swatches
Use the Adobe Swatch Exchange (`.ase`) files in this repo to ensure consistent color use in working with the Adobe Creative Suite. Place a copy of the file into the following locations for them to appear natively in the Swatch menu (`Window > Swatches`):

#### Photoshop
`~/Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS6/Presets/Color Swatches/`

#### Illustrator
`~/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CS6/Presets/Swatches/`

#### Indesign
`~/Applications/Applications/Adobe InDesign CS6/Presets/Swatch Libraries/`

#### Note
You may find it easier/more efficient to clone the swatch files to a single location (say `~/Dropbox/Swatches/`), then load them in-app as needed.


### JSON
JSON files containing color and variable names, Hex, RGBa, and HSLa values.
